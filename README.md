# Machine-Learning-Project
In this project, we will be predicting the unit sales for thousands of items sold at different Favorita stores located in Ecuador. The training data includes dates, store and item information, whether that item was being promoted, as well as the unit sales. 

## Phase-1 : Data pre-processing :
1. Merging all the CSV into train.csv based on the respective parameters
2. Replacing the empty/blank values with NULL
3. Split the dataset for training & testing - Sampling Techniques
4. Visualization of the training dataset -> Matplotlib, SeaBorn ,etc.

## Phase-2 : Training :
1. Choose 2-3 best matched algorithm for our data
2. Comparative analysis: different models from different/same algorithm (Parameter tuning). Which one is the best one? Through error metric

## Phase-3 :
1. Train the best model with all the data to predict on the test dataset
